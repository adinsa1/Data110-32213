## Visualize Proportion Assignment

### Objective
This assignment involves creating a DataFrame and utilizing it for visualization purposes, such as crafting pie charts, transforming a pie chart into a donut chart, and visualizing data with a stacked bar graph.
### Assignment Overview
1. **DataFrame Creation**
    - Create a pandas DataFrame that includes a 'Category' column with 5 unique categories and a 'Values' column with numerical values associated with each category. 

2. **Pie Chart Visualization**
    - Visualize your data with a pie chart. Ensure each segment of the pie is labeled with the category names and displays the percentage of the total for each category.

3. **Donut Chart Transformation**
    - Transform the pie chart into a donut chart by adding a circle at the center to create a "hole" in the middle of the pie chart. Discuss how the visual perception of the data changes with this transformation.

4. **Stacked Bar Graph Visualization**
    - Represent the same data with a stacked bar graph. This should include using different colors to represent each category and adding a legend for interpretation. Reflect on the effectiveness of the stacked bar graph in comparison to the pie and donut charts.

### Instructions

- **Data Preparation:** Your first task is to prepare the data. Create a DataFrame in pandas with your chosen categories and values.
- **Visualization Tasks:** After preparing your data, you will create three types of visualizations:
    - A pie chart that shows the distribution of values across categories.
    - A donut chart, modifying the pie chart by adding a circular "hole" in the middle.
    - A stacked bar graph that represents the categories' values stacked upon each other.
- **Analysis and Reflection:** For each visualization type, provide a brief analysis of what the visual representation tells you about the data. Reflect on the process of creating the DataFrame and visualizing the data. Discuss the insights gained from each type of visualization and the effectiveness of different styles in highlighting aspects of the data.
