# Weekly 10 Summary: Visualizing Trends in Data

## This Week's Focus
This week, we worked on  visualizing trends within datasets using Python, focusing particularly on the [Blue Jays](https://wilkelab.org/DSC385/datasets/blue_jays.csv) and [Cars93 datasets](https://wilkelab.org/DSC385/datasets/cars93.csv). These datasets served as the basis for our code-driven exploration of various visualization techniques.

You can find the code from last week in this [link](Map_Week10%2611.ipynb). Please skip the part related to Map. This will be coverd this week. 
## Key Topics
- **Visualization Techniques**: We leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn to create detailed visual representations such as scatter plots, regression lines, and heatmaps. This helped us explore and understand the relationships in the datasets of Blue Jays and Cars93.
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the datasets. The discussions included strategies for using visualization tools to reveal complex data interactions effectively.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzed data trends by visualizing relationships between variables such as body mass and head length in Blue Jays, and price and fuel tank capacity in Cars93. Emphasized the application of linear models and regression lines to illustrate these relationships and deduce meaningful insights.

## Assignment
To apply the visualization techniques learned, complete a project based on the trends observed in the Blue Jays and Cars93 datasets. This assignment focuses on utilizing trend visualization to interpret and analyze data effectively. Access the assignment [Week10_HW](Week10_HW.md).
