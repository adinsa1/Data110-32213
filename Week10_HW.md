# Iris Dataset Analysis Assignment

## Objective
This assignment aims to develop skills in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling using the Iris dataset. The dataset includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), each measured across four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
```
import seaborn as sns
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
```
## Instructions
Complete each part of the assignment using Python (libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and submit a Jupyter notebook containing your code, visualizations, and a brief explanation of your findings.

### Part 1: Data Exploration and Visualization
#### 1. Loading the Data
- Load the Iris dataset. You can find it in the `seaborn` library by using `sns.load_dataset('iris')`.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

#### 2. Data Summaries
- Provide summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each feature. Discuss any initial observations about scales, ranges, and typical values.

#### 3. Visualizations
- Create histograms for each feature to understand the distributions.
- Generate box plots for each feature to identify any outliers and compare distributions across different iris species.

### Part 2: Detailed Analysis by Species
#### 1. Comparative Analysis
- Use scatter plots to compare sepal length and width, as well as petal length and width. Color the points by species to explore how the species differ based on these dimensions.
- Discuss any patterns or clusters that you observe in the scatter plots.

#### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix for the features. Consider using a heatmap for better clarity.
- Interpret the correlations between different features. Reflect on how these relationships might differ by species if applicable.

### Part 3: Regression Analysis
#### 1. Simple Linear Regression
- Choose one dimension (e.g., petal length) as a predictor for another (e.g., sepal length). Fit a linear regression model and plot the regression line.
- Evaluate the fit of the model and discuss its effectiveness in predicting the dependent variable.

#### 2. Multivariate Regression ( Optional, we need to cover it later)
- Expand your model to include more variables. Fit a multivariate regression model to predict one feature based on others.
- Interpret the coefficients of the model and discuss any surprising or expected relationships.

### Part 4: Reflection and Interpretation
#### 1. Summary of Findings
- Summarize the key insights gained from your analyses. What did you learn about the different iris species?
- Discuss the effectiveness of different visualization techniques in revealing the underlying structure of the data.
