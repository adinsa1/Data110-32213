## Week 9 Overview: Visualizing Data Proportions

- **Objective:**  visualization techniques using Python, focusing on:
  - Creating pie and donut charts to showcase data proportions.
  - Exploring stacked bar graphs for cumulative data representation.
  - Introducing Voronoi diagrams for spatial data visualization.

- **Key Tools:**
  - **pandas:** For data manipulation.
  - **matplotlib.pyplot:** For crafting visualizations.
  - **numpy:** For numerical operations.

- **Week Highlights:**
  - **Pie Charts:** Illustrated segment proportions within datasets.
  - **Donut Charts:** Added a central "hole" to pie charts for a different visual effect.
  - **Stacked Bar Graphs:** Visualized cumulative values of categories.
  - **Voronoi Diagrams:** Explored spatial relationships and distributions.

- **Application:** Analyzed the composition of the 8th German Bundestag using the techniques above, emphasizing practical application and critical analysis of visual data.

- **Assignment:** A hands-on task to apply learned skills on a custom dataset, reinforcing the week's concepts.
